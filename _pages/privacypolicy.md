## Debugging Data
We use Apple’s opt-in service for crash reporting. Your device model, iOS version and the date that the crash occurred will be viewable by us. However, no personally identifiable information is kept by us or sent anywhere externally. The only things we will see are what steps were taken before the crash occurred. We will not see any of the data you’ve entered into the app.

## Personal Data
Put simply, nothing you enter in Oh Bother is ever viewable by us. For debugging purposes, we may ask you to provide some personal data to troubleshoot an issue, if you're willing. Otherwise, all data is written directly to your device, and any data that’s synced to the cloud or shared by you with other users is done so via Apple’s iCloud services and is therefore not accessible to us.

We have no idea who any of our users are, and we think that's the way it should be!

## Any Questions?
If you have any questions at all about your data, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:danielgauthier.dev@gmail.com).
