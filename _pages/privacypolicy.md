## Debugging Data
We use Apple’s opt-in service for crash reporting. Your device model, iOS version and the date that the crash occurred will be viewable by us. However, no personally identifiable information is kept by us or sent anywhere externally. The only things we will see are what steps were taken before the crash occurred. We will not see any of the data you’ve entered into the app.

## Personal Data
Drinksly will not require that you enter any information that identifies you. We do utitilize advertisements in the app that may require the use of the IDFA of your device. This identifier, if allowed to be tracked by you, will be transmitted when viewing the advertisement and will be used by AdMob to better serve relevant ads to you. You can opt out of using this identifier from the app when prompted or in the App Settings portion in the device settings.

Drinksly also allows you to annonymously submit a drink (which may include a photo). This data will be uploaded to a database where we will analyze and make sure that it meets our requirements. Upon approval your image will be removed and a proper image will be included.

We have no idea who any of our users are, and we think that's the way it should be!

## Any Questions?
If you have any questions at all about your data, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:contact@drinkslyapp.com).
